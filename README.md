Recently, I stumbled upon [_this_](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/) software-engineering related article, which contains some good advice for computer science students like myself.

In this article, [developer Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/about-me/) provides computer science students advice related to both learning computer science, and college classes in general. His advice can be summarized in the following points:

1. Learn how to write before graduating.
2. Learn C before graduating.
3. Learn microeconomics before graduating.
4. Don’t blow off non-CS classes just because they’re boring.
5. Take programming-intensive courses.
6. Stop worrying about all the jobs going to India.
7. No matter what you do, get a **good** summer internship.

I find this article quite interesting because not only does it provide students with conventional advice related to computer science courses, internships and jobs, but also advices them to do well in avenues not necessarily related to computer science, but to college as a whole.

One particular idea mentioned in the article that stands out to me is that the author realizes that his advice may become outdated, much like most CS-related advice out there. To quote, he says:

> I, too, have no idea what I’m talking about when I give advice to college students. I’m so hopelessly out of date that I can’t really figure out AIM and still use (horrors!) this quaint old thing called “email” which was popular in the days when music came on flat round plates called “CDs.”
>
> So you’d be better off ignoring what I’m saying here and instead building some kind of [online software thing](http://www.thefacebook.com/) that lets other students find people to go out on dates with.

Given the variety of points discussed in this article, I believe that it is a worthwhile read for any comptuer science student in college.
